# 567_ShoppingDealsTracker_API
This repository is for Team6's Group Project for Course 567 on the topic of a Shopping Deals Tracker. This is repository is only for the API team of the project

## How to setup environment

What to install:
Node.js : [Node.JS Link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
MongoDB/Compass : [MongoDB Link](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community) *I install Compass to use as a DB GUI*
Postman : [Postman Link](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) *Its not required, I just like it to test requests*

Once you have installed the following, you will need to clone the repo to wherever you please.
Then you will need to install the matching packages, to do so open whatever command line interface you use.
Once open find the folder where the project is and step into the folder insuring you are in
the same directory as the package-lock.json. Once you are you can then run the following command:
*npm -i* or *npm install*.

Once they dependences have been installed and you have the database running in the base form (nothing needs to be changed when setting it up).

you can run the program using: *npm start*.

Troubleshoot errors throughout the process to make sure you installed things correctly.

Finally don't worry about the test folder at the moment. It is a work in progress on my end for automated testing of API calls(still learning on the fly).
